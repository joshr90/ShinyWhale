 Estimate abundance and demographic parameters for North Atlantic right whales

### Overview
***
This app is designed to provide simplified tool for estimating abundance and demographic information for North Atlantic right whales. With the use of this app, we aim to provide managers, NGOs, government organisations and conservationists a tool to assess the changes in the NARW population, without the need to understand the complete workings of Bayesian mark-recapture techniques, or strong programming skills. 
This app is designed to use data provided by the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium, and uses their data structure to conduct the model.
The columns required for this app are as below, please ensure that the column headings match:

SightingEGNo | SightingYear | SightingMonth | SightingDay | Behaviors
-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------
